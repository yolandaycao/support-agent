# Format: Q&A

Q: Our internet connection is slow across the office. How can we troubleshoot this?
A: Run bandwidth tests from multiple devices in different office locations to establish if the slowdown is universal. Check network utilization dashboards to identify any unusual activity or bandwidth-heavy applications. Determine if the issue is with your internal network or your ISP by testing direct connections to the router. Look for large downloads, updates, or backups that might be in progress. Identify potential network bottlenecks like outdated switches or routers. If the issue appears to be ISP-related, open a support ticket with your provider. Consider implementing temporary traffic shaping rules to prioritize business-critical applications until the issue is resolved.

Q: We can't connect to our VPN from remote locations. What should we check?
A: First verify that your VPN server is online and accessible by checking its status through your monitoring system. Have users confirm their VPN credentials and ensure their certificates haven't expired. Check that users have the latest version of the VPN client software. Test connections from different networks to determine if the issue is specific to certain locations or ISPs. Check for firewall or security software that might be blocking VPN traffic on user devices. Verify DNS resolution is working properly. If the issue is widespread, investigate potential problems with your VPN appliance, including CPU utilization, memory usage, and connection limits.

Q: Why do some of our employees have trouble with Wi-Fi in certain parts of the office?
A: Conduct a wireless site survey to identify dead zones and areas with weak signal. Check for physical obstructions or interference sources in problem areas. Verify that access points are optimally positioned and using appropriate channels to minimize interference. Consider adding additional access points to improve coverage in problem areas. Update firmware on wireless access points to ensure you have the latest bug fixes and performance improvements. Check if the affected devices have updated wireless drivers. Consider implementing a mesh network solution if building layout creates challenging Wi-Fi conditions.

Q: My computer is running very slowly after the latest update. How can I fix it?
A: Check your system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk) using Task Manager or Activity Monitor to identify resource-intensive processes. See if specific applications are causing high resource usage. Make sure all updates have completed installation and no restarts are pending. Run system diagnostics to check for hardware issues, particularly with storage devices. Scan for malware or unwanted background processes. Optimize your startup applications by disabling unnecessary programs that launch at boot. If performance issues persist after these steps, consider a system refresh or evaluate if hardware upgrades are needed.

Q: Our server is showing a disk space warning. What steps should we take?
A: Use disk space analysis tools to identify the largest files and folders contributing to space usage. Look for log files that may need rotation or cleanup, especially application and system logs that grow continuously. Check for backup files that may be stored locally instead of on dedicated backup storage. Look for temporary files in system and application temp directories that can be safely removed. Analyze disk space growth trends to predict future needs and plan accordingly. Implement more detailed disk space monitoring with earlier warning thresholds. If cleanup doesn't provide sufficient space, evaluate options for storage expansion.

Q: We're receiving unexpected charges on our cloud bill. How do we investigate this?
A: Review detailed billing reports from your cloud provider to identify specific services generating unexpected costs. Check for unused resources that may still be running, such as development environments or test instances. Identify services showing unusual usage patterns that might indicate misconfigurations or potential security incidents. Implement cost management tools and budget alerts to provide earlier warnings of spending anomalies. Review auto-scaling settings to ensure they have appropriate thresholds. Implement resource tagging for better cost allocation by department, project, or environment. Consider using cloud cost optimization tools that can identify savings opportunities.

Q: How do we migrate our on-premise server to the cloud?
A: Begin with a thorough assessment of your current server specifications, workloads, and performance requirements. Identify all dependencies and integration points with other systems. Develop a migration strategy, deciding between lift-and-shift (rehosting) or refactoring approaches based on the application architecture. Create comprehensive backup and rollback plans before beginning the migration. Schedule the migration during a time window with minimal business impact. Thoroughly test all applications in the cloud environment before final cutover. After successful migration, update DNS records and access points to direct traffic to the cloud resources, while maintaining fallback options until stability is confirmed.
